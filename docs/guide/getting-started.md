# Introduction

India Compliance has been designed to make compliance with Indian rules and regulations simple, swift and reliable. To this end, it has been carefully integrated with GST APIs to simplify recurring compliance processes.

It builds on top of [ERPNext](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext) and the [Frappe Framework](https://github.com/frappe/frappe) - incredible FOSS projects built and maintained by the incredible folks at Frappe. Go check these out if you haven't already!
